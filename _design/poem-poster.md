## Project Overview
The quote, “All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream” from  A Dream Within a Dream is a philosophical piece of literature by Edgar Allan Poe that brings the perception of life, time and reality to question.  The design utilizes Poe’s symbolism and spiraling emotions to convey the deeper meaning behind the quote and poem as a whole. 

The work features a singular scene trapped inside another to emulate this point.  The inside figure is rushing through a portal of shores, as the larger figure tries to hold it all in. Typography is plain and bold, slowly getting more whimsical near the main point/end of the tidal wave. The quote is placed in a spiral motion to convey Poe’s confusion on the world. Words were housed in all different directions till you get to Poe’s conclusion, “A Dream Within a Dream”. Cool blues were introduced to give a soulful tone, being contrasted with hints of yellow in the eyes and smaller figure for interest.   

All these elements come together to make a striking image that ponders life and how we live in the universe.  This piece is meant to have the viewer ponder, asking the question if their reality is, in fact, real or just a fantasy.

## Tools & Techniques

- Adobe Photoshop for values
- Photoshop watercolor and pastel brushes to create a hand-painted feel
- Use of vibrant color palette to emulate a dream-like state
- Use of warped and out of place typography to enhance the poems meaning and questioning

## Outcomes

This project helped develop an understanding for how impactful a color palette can be, and how emotions can be a driving force of a moving design. Designing this poster helped me understand the importance of knowing what feeling you wish to tell the viewer in order to convey a meaningful story.
