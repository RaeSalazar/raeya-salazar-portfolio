## Project Overview

The fashion show poster emulates the "Mariposa" butterfly theme by having little butterfly faires create a dress on a model. The design uses the rule of thirds to capture the audience's attention, with a organized grid-like layout of typography hidden inside the model's dress for contrast between the flowing fabric and improve legibility.

## Tools & Techniques

- Adobe InDesign for text and logo layout
- Adobe Photoshop for texture, glow effects, and brushing in values
- Air brush effect to create a soft tone
- Natural color palette to reflect butterfly theme. 

## Outcomes

This project helped develop a greater sense of visual hierarchy and understand how to organize typography using only what is provided by a client. The final posters was created at two sizes, 11"x17" and 24"x36" for review.
