## Project Overview

This sticker illustration project was a character/creature creation meant to demonstrate a unique characteristic in nature. With its target audience being todlers and younger children, the playful parts of nature were emulated in the form of an adorable character. The sticker plays with the viewer as, instead of an acron falling from the tree, it floats on a leaf.

## Tools & Techniques

- Adobe Illustrator for vector paths
- Adobe Photoshop for blending highlights (path selections)
- Reference of acron patterns for hat

## Outcomes

This project helped me develop an understanding for character design, and how contrast plays a significant role in creating unique, and interesting characters (for example, this sticker contrasted big head with small body/feet). It has also provided me insight on how to target towards differernt audiences.
